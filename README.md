# Chapter 8: Interfaces in C# - *CSharpPro*

This repository is based on Chapter 8 of *CSharpPro*, focusing on **interfaces** in C#. It includes examples and exercises to demonstrate how interfaces define contracts for consistent functionality across different implementations, supporting polymorphism and more flexible code design.

## Key Concepts
- **Interface Basics** – How to define and implement interfaces in C#.
- **Polymorphism with Interfaces** – Enabling multiple implementations that share a common contract.
- **Practical Examples** – Code samples illustrating interfaces in action, enhancing reusability and flexibility.

This repository is a reference for mastering interfaces, following concepts from *CSharpPro* to improve modularity and maintainability in C# applications.
